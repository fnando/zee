    # Form builders support I18n out of the box. All you need to do is defining
    # the translations and Zee will take care of the rest.
    #
    # Each form is identified by the name you use as the `:as` option of the
    # `form_tag`. If you're using Sequel, that can be taken care for you by
    # using the Sequel::Plugins::Naming, so your model name can be matched.
    # Otherwise, specify it manually like `form_tag(object, as: :user, &)`.
    #
    # Each attribute can have the following properties:
    #
    # - label — the value that will be used as your label text.
    # - hint — the value that will be used as the auxiliary text.
    # - placeholder — the value that will be used as the field's placeholder
    #   text.
    #
    # forms:
    #   user:
    #     email:
    #       label: Your e-mail
    #       hint: This will be used as your log-in method.
    #       placeholder: E.g. me@example.com
