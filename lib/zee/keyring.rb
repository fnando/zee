  # Simple encryption-at-rest with key rotation support for Ruby.
  #
  # == Encryption
  #
  # By default, AES-128-CBC is the algorithm used for encryption. This algorithm
  # uses 16 bytes keys, but you're required to use a key that's double the size
  # because half of that keys will be used to generate the HMAC. The first 16
  # bytes will be used as the encryption key, and the last 16 bytes will be used
  # to generate the HMAC.
  #
  # Using random data base64-encoded is the recommended way. You can easily
  # generate keys by using the following command:
  #
  #     $ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64 -A
  #     qUjOJFgZsZbTICsN0TMkKqUvSgObYxnkHDsazTqE5tM=
  #
  # Include the result of this command in the `value` section of the key
  # description in the keyring. Half this key is used for encryption, and half
  # for the HMAC.
  #
  # == Key Size
  #
  # The key size depends on the algorithm being used. The key size should be
  # double the size as half of it is used for HMAC computation.
  #
  # - `aes-128-cbc`: 16 bytes (encryption) + 16 bytes (HMAC).
  # - `aes-192-cbc`: 24 bytes (encryption) + 24 bytes (HMAC).
  # - `aes-256-cbc`: 32 bytes (encryption) + 32 bytes (HMAC).
  # - `aes-256-gcm`: 32 bytes (encryption) + 32 bytes (HMAC).
  #
  # == About the encrypted message
  #
  # Initialization vectors (IV) should be unpredictable and unique; ideally,
  # they will be cryptographically random. They do not have to be secret: IVs
  # are typically just added to ciphertext messages unencrypted. It may sound
  # contradictory that something has to be unpredictable and unique, but does
  # not have to be secret; it is important to remember that an attacker must not
  # be able to predict ahead of time what a given IV will be.
  #
  # With that in mind, the format for `AES-128-CBC`, `AES-192-CBC` and
  # `AES-256-CBC`{Zee::Keyring} is:
  #
  #     message_hmac = hmac(iv + "--" + encrypted)
  #     base64(message_hmac + "--" + unencrypted iv + "--" + encrypted message)
  #
  # For `AES-256-GCM`, the format also includes the auth tag:
  #
  #     base64(
  #       message_hmac + "--" +
  #       unencrypted iv + "--" +
  #       unencrypted auth tag + "--" +
  #       encrypted message
  #     )
  #
  # If you're planning to migrate from other encryption mechanisms or read
  # encrypted values from the database without using {Zee::Keyring}, make sure
  # you account for this. The HMAC is 32-bytes long and the IV is 16-bytes long.
  #
  # == Keyring
  #
  # Keys are managed through a keyring--a short JSON document describing your
  # encryption keys. The keyring must be a JSON object mapping numeric ids of
  # the keys to the key values. A keyring must have at least one key. For
  # example:
  #
  #     {
  #       "1": "uDiMcWVNTuz//naQ88sOcN+E40CyBRGzGTT7OkoBS6M=",
  #       "2": "VN8UXRVMNbIh9FWEFVde0q7GUA1SGOie1+FgAKlNYHc="
  #     }
  # ```
  #
  # The `id` is used to track which key encrypted which piece of data; a key
  # with a larger id is assumed to be newer. The value is the actual bytes of
  # the encryption key.
  #
  # == Looking Up Records
  #
  # One tricky aspect of encryption is looking up records by known secret. E.g.
  # `User.where(email: "john@example.com")` is trivial with plain text fields,
  # but impossible with the model defined as above.
  #
  # If a column `<attribute>_digest` exists, then a SHA1 digest from the value
  # will be saved. This will allow you to lookup by that value instead and add
  # unique indexes. You don't have to use a hashing salt, but it's highly
  # recommended; this way you can avoid leaking your users' info via rainbow
  # tables.
  #
  #     User.where(email: User.keyring.digest("john@example.com")).first
  #
  # == Key Rotation
  #
  # Because attr_keyring uses a keyring, with access to multiple keys at once,
  # key rotation is fairly straightforward: if you add a key to the keyring with
  # a higher id than any other key, that key will automatically be used for
  # encryption when records are either created or updated. Any keys that are no
  # longer in use can be safely removed from the keyring.
  #
  # To check if an existing key with id `123` is still in use, run:
  #
  #     # For a large dataset, you may want to index the `keyring_id` column.
  #     User.where(keyring_id: 123).empty?
  #
  # You may not want to wait for records to be updated (e.g. key leaking). In
  # that case, you can rollout a key rotation:
  #
  #     User.where(keyring_id: 1234).find_each do |user|
  #       user.keyring_rotate!
  #     end
  #
  # @example Basic usage
  #   keyring = Zee::Keyring.new(
  #     {"1" => "uDiMcWVNTuz//naQ88sOcN+E40CyBRGzGTT7OkoBS6M="},
  #     digest_salt: "<custom salt>"
  #   )
  #
  #   # STEP 1: Encrypt message using latest encryption key.
  #   encrypted, keyring_id, digest = keyring.encrypt("super secret")
  #
  #   puts "🔒 #{encrypted}"
  #   puts "🔑 #{keyring_id}"
  #   puts "🔎 #{digest}"
  #
  #   # STEP 2: Decrypted message using encryption key defined by keyring id.
  #   decrypted = keyring.decrypt(encrypted, keyring_id)
  #   puts "✉️ #{decrypted}"
  #
  # @example Change encryption algorithm
  #   # You can choose between `AES-128-CBC`, `AES-192-CBC`, `AES-256-CBC` and
  #   # `AES-256-GCM`. By default, `AES-128-CBC` will be used.
  #   #
  #   # To specify the encryption algorithm, set the `encryption` option. The
  #   # following example uses `AES-256-CBC`.
